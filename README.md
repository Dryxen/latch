Latch is an extensive container and entity locking plugin for Sponge that
is still a work in progress, but is getting better and better everyday.
We have a lot configurability for each lock and more is being added often
as well as some nice administration commands. If you need any information
visit our page on [Ore](https://ore.spongepowered.org/IchorPowered/Latch)
or come on to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/V2PFPkn) and someone should
be able to help you. If you have any suggestions please mention them
here on Github or on our Ore page. I hope you enjoy our plugin!
